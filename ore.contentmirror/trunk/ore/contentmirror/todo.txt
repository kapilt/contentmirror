Todo List

containment order
-----------------

so with container positions off the root, what if the a serialized content has
no container... then it would get pulled out for the portal query. the only
way to distinguish it would be on the basis of contained's relative_path or path
attributes. in conjunction with having some serialized content in non serializable
containers, this could lead to situations where we're loading unesc. content peers
from the database. they could potentially match on id with content in the portal
root and there by become serialized with an invalid portal id.

for serializable content in non serializable containers, effectively we won't be
serializing folder positions as their won't be an applicable operation factory
or serializer for them.

with positioning going through the event/operation system, ideally we need to support
more than one event per transaction for content, as repositions on the container
are orthogonal to other events. realistically its not a concern, the only api
method that would trigger a reposition is rename which we handle specially to
filter out as its redundant. all the other repositions are triggered as a result
of ui scripts afaics.

script execution
----------------

currently we utilize instance run path_to_script.py, which is more than a little
painful, esp. as we switch out to primarily egg installations. we should use a
trick to get access the app variable for the scripts.

- frame tricks for making scripts easy to run without pointing to egg source files.

additional tests
----------------

 - need some tests for content in an unserializable container
 - tests with references to non serializable content
