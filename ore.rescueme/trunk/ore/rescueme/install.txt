Install the Software
====================

The software can be installed via buildout by adding it to the eggs section of an instance. ie:

 eggs =
    ${plone:eggs}
    ore.rescueme

Configuring
===========

The following zcml snippet will configure the system:

 <include package="ore.alchemist" file="meta.zcml"/>
 <include package="ore.rescueme" file="meta.zcml"/>
 <include package="ore.rescueme"/>

  <configure xmlns:db="http://namespaces.objectrealms.net/rdb">
   <db:engine url="postgres://localhost/contentmirror"
	     name="mirror-db"
             echo="True"/>
   <db:bind engine="mirror-db"			 
 	   metadata="ore.rescueme.schema.metadata"
 	   />
  </configure>

and can be added to as a zcml slug ( $INSTANCE_HOME/etc/package-includes ) or directly
from within a custom Product's configure.zcml file.

Database Setup
==============

Next you'll need to generate the SQL DDL/Schema file for your target database. The package when installed creates a command line script that will generate the database schema. This script needs to be executed with the Zope environment loaded, in order to determine which content types

if your running in a buildout you achieve that via the following.

  $ ./bin/instance run ./bin/mirror-ddl mysql > mirror.sql
  
if your running as Plone in a standard zope instance, you can do the following

  $ $INSTANCE_HOME/bin/zopectl run `which mirror-ddl` postgres > mirror.sql

the mirror-ddl script takes one parameter, the name of the target database to deploy to, names are those available as SQLAlchemy database driver names.
