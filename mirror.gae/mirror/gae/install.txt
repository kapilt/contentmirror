Buildout Installation
---------------------

Basically, you need to include the mirror.gae egg, load its configure.zcml
and meta.zcml files and add the location of the GAE toolkit where the
plonegine app is installed as an extra path, together with other GAE libs.

Example buildout configuration for a plone instance:

[instance1]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
zope2-location = ${zope2:location}
user = admin:admin
http-address = 8081
debug-mode = on
verbose-security = on
gae-location = /home/cguardia/work/google_appengine
extra-paths = ${instance1:gae-location}
              ${instance1:gae-location}/lib/antlr3
              ${instance1:gae-location}/lib/django
              ${instance1:gae-location}/lib/webob
              ${instance1:gae-location}/lib/yaml/lib

eggs =
    ${buildout:eggs}
    ${plone:eggs}
    mirror.gae

zcml =
    mirror.gae
    mirror.gae-meta

products =
    ${buildout:directory}/products
    ${productdistros:location}
    ${plone:products}


Configuring
------------

Before ContentMirror will work, it *must* be configured. Configuration
is done via ZCML ( Zope Configuration Markup Language ). The Content
Mirror product contains a few zcml files in it, that load up the base system, 
as well a sample configuration.

Inside of Content Mirror is a file called settings-example.zcml, you should rename this
file to settings.zcml and make your modifications to it.

The contents of this file are::

<configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope" 
	   xmlns:mirror="http://namespaces.objectrealms.net/mirror"> 

    <!-- set up an app engine connection -->
   <mirror:appengine app_id="plonemirror"
                     host="plonemirror.appspot.com"
                     username="appengine_username"
                     password="password"/>

   <!-- If Your Running on Plone 2.5, you must uncomment the following line 
   <include package="ore.contentmirror" file="legacy.zcml"/>
   -->

</configure>


The mirror:appengine directive is used to specify an app engine connection.

The setting-example.zcml uses the mirror:appengine directive to setup a
connection to an application with id plonemirror running on host
plonemirror.appspot.com. You need to include your app engine username and
password in the configuration.

If your running on Plone 2.5, you also need to include/uncomment the following
zcml line in settings.zcml::

  <include package="ore.rescueme" file="legacy.zcml"/>
